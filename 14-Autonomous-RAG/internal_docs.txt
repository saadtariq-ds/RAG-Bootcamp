Title: Transformer Variants for Production

We have used the following transformer variants in production deployments:

1. EfficientFormer:
    - Optimized for mobile inference.
    - Deployed in multiple mobile and edge environments.
    - Quantized using ONNX and optimized via TensorRT.
    - Benchmarked with 1.2ms inference time on A72 CPUs.

2. Longformer:
    - Applied to long-context document summarization and legal document review.
    - Token window increased to 8192 with sliding window attention.
    - Used with chunk-based summarization pipeline.
    - Attention weights visualized using in-house tools for explainability.

3. Reformer:
    - Tested for memory efficiency on embedded devices.
    - LSH attention led to 60% memory reduction.
    - Integration challenges with standard transformers due to bucket collisions.
    - Ongoing investigation for training stability and gradient clipping strategies.

4. LLAMA2:
    - Integrated with proprietary instruction-tuned layer.
    - Combined with domain-specific knowledge graphs.
    - Used as base model in chat deployment.
    - Prompt format adapted with multi-turn chat memory and RAG backend.

5. TinyBERT:
    - Fine-tuned for classification tasks on internal email triage system.
    - Integrated into Outlook plugin via TensorFlow Lite.

Deployment Architecture:
    - Core stack: FastAPI + TorchServe, optionally with Ray Serve
    - Autoscaling based on queue length using Kubernetes + KEDA
    - Model sharding: DeepSpeed stage 3 and HuggingFace Accelerate
    - Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
    - Alerting: Latency thresholds, memory usage spikes

Optimizations:
    - Distillation of teacher-student models using response alignment
    - Knowledge injection via adapters
    - Mixed-precision training (AMP) with Nvidia A100s
    - Use of DVC and MLflow for experiment tracking
    - Canary rollout strategy for model updates
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions Docker EKS with Helm charts

Additional Notes:
    - Vision transformers (ViT and Swin Transformer) evaluated in manufacturing QC tasks.
    - Speech transformers (Wav2Vec 2.0) benchmarked for voice assistant integrations.
    - Tokenizers: SentencePiece, BPE, and unigram tokenizers compared for multilingual tasks.
    - Significant improvements noted with FlashAttention and Rotary Positional Encoding.
