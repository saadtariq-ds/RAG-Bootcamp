    "Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readable & Simple Syntax: Python emphasizes code readability, using indentation instead of braces, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
    "- Interpreted & Dynamically Typed: No need to compile before running, and variable types are determined at runtime.\n",
    "- Extensive Libraries: Python has thousands of libraries for tasks like data science (pandas, numpy), AI/ML (scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch), web development (Django, Flask), automation (selenium, requests), and more.\n",
    "- Cross-Platform: Python code runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even embedded systems.\n",
    "- Community Support: A vast community and ecosystem make it easy to find tutorials, documentation, and open-source projects.\n",

    "1. Data Science & Machine Learning – analyzing data, training ML models, and building AI solutions.\n",
    "2. Web Development – creating websites and APIs with frameworks like Django and Flask.\n",
    "3. Automation & Scripting – writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.\n",
    "4. Software Development – building desktop and mobile applications.\n",
    "5. Game Development – libraries like pygame enable 2D game creation.\n",
