Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and 
improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, ML models use patterns in data to make predictions, 
classifications, or decisions.

Key Concepts

- Data: The foundation of MLâ€”models learn from examples (structured data like tables or unstructured data like text, images, audio).

- Features & Labels: Features are input variables; labels are the outcomes you want to predict.

- Model: A mathematical representation that maps input data to predictions.

- Training & Testing: Training teaches the model patterns; testing evaluates performance on unseen data.

Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:

- Supervised: Learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices).

- Unsupervised: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).

- Reinforcement Learning: Models learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards/penalties).
