Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

      "## The Fall and Rebirth: Steve Jobs' Tumultuous Departure from Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Jobs' relationship with Apple was a complex and tumultuous one, marked by both brilliance and conflict. While he is rightfully celebrated as the visionary behind Apple's success, his departure from the company in 1985 remains a significant chapter in the company's history.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**The Events Leading to the Firing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs' departure wasn't a sudden event, but rather the culmination of several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clashing Personalities:** Jobs, known for his demanding and often abrasive management style, clashed frequently with John Sculley, Apple's CEO, whom Jobs himself had hired in 1983. \n",
      "* **The Macintosh's Performance:** While the Macintosh was revolutionary and groundbreaking, its initial sales fell short of expectations. This led to internal pressure and scrutiny, with Jobs bearing the brunt of the blame.\n",
      "* **Power Struggle:** As Apple grew, a power struggle emerged between Jobs, who championed the Macintosh and its creative vision, and the board of directors, who favoured a more pragmatic and business-oriented approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final straw came with the launch of the Macintosh II. Jobs, convinced of the need for a faster processor, pushed for a higher-priced model. This decision, ultimately approved by the board, further alienated Jobs from Sculley and the board, who saw it as a risky move.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Formal Firing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "On **September 12, 1985**, the Apple board, led by Sculley, voted to remove Jobs from his position as CEO of Apple and from the board of directors.  Jobs, who had been in charge of the Macintosh division, was effectively pushed out of the company he co-founded.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Aftermath:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs' departure was a shock to the tech world. While some celebrated his removal, others mourned the loss of his visionary leadership. Jobs, however, refused to wallow in self-pity. He founded NeXT, a computer company that, while commercially unsuccessful, would later be acquired by Apple, paving the way for Jobs' triumphant return in 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs' firing from Apple was a pivotal moment, shaping both his personal journey and the trajectory of the company itself. It marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter, one that ultimately led to Apple's resurgence as a global tech giant.  \n",
